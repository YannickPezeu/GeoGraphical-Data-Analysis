# Analysis of the city of Chartres

**This repository serves to show my ability to write python code using numpy, pandas, matplotlib and to use these tools to create insights**

This was the capstone project of the IBM Data Science professional certificate. 
I analysed the different areas in Chartres because my mother wanted to move there.
She now lives happily in a nice area in Chartres.
